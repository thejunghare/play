## Question Paper Pattern for NoSQL DB (MongoDB \& Firebase) – Indian Engineering University (2025)

Below is a recommended pattern **in alignment with current Indian engineering exam standards**. The paper is split into two independent sections:[^1][^2]

### 1. Practical-Based Question Paper (40 marks)

- **Total Marks:** 40
- **Duration:** 1.5 to 2 hours
- **Question Types:** Hands-on tasks, mini-projects, real-world scenario simulations, and problem-solving activities using MongoDB and Firebase environments.
- **Instruction:** Students may use computers and/or write answers describing code/scripts, schemas, and admin procedures.

**Sections**

- Task 1: Data Modeling \& Design (10 marks)
    - Design/Implement a schema or data structure for a real-world application
- Task 2: CRUD \& Query Operations (10 marks)
    - Given sample data, write/perform insert, update, delete, read, aggregation, indexing, and projection queries
- Task 3: Administration \& Scaling (10 marks)
    - Simulate/describe sharding, replication, backup, restore, validation, user roles, or hosting processes
- Task 4: Integration \& Application (10 marks)
    - Build or describe a mini-project, integrating database functions; may include authentication, hosting, messaging, etc.

***

### 2. Theory-Based Question Paper (40 marks)

- **Total Marks:** 40
- **Duration:** 1.5 hours
- **Question Types:**
    - **Section A:** Multiple Choice Questions (10 × 1 = 10 marks)
    - **Section B:** Short Answer/Descriptive (6 × 5 = 30 marks)
(Can be direct theory, explanations, examples, or comparative analysis)

**Sections**

- **Section A: MCQ (10 marks)**
    - 10 questions, single choice, 1 mark each.
- **Section B: Subjective (30 marks)**
    - 6 questions out of 8 (Attempt any 6), each 5 marks.
    - Includes short and medium-length descriptive answers, diagrams, code snippets, comparative tables.

## Sample Question Papers

### Sample Practical-Based Question Paper (40 Marks)

#### Instructions

- All questions are compulsory.
- Use MongoDB shell/Compass and Firebase Console where required.
- Show screenshots/commands/code wherever applicable.
- Attach schemas or model diagrams as needed.


#### Question Paper

1. **Data Modeling \& Design (10 marks)**
    - Design a denormalized document schema for a library management system using MongoDB. Explain the choice of embedded and referenced documents with examples.
2. **CRUD \& Query Operations (10 marks)**
    - Using a given collection of student records, write MongoDB queries to:
        - a) Insert a new record.
        - b) Update a student's details.
        - c) Delete a record by ID.
        - d) Find all students enrolled after 2023.
        - e) Project only 'name' and 'email' fields in the result.
3. **Administration \& Scaling (10 marks)**
    - a) Explain the steps to set up a replica set in MongoDB. What is the role of the primary and secondary nodes?
    - b) Using mongodump and mongorestore, describe how to backup and restore a database.
4. **Integration \& Application (10 marks)**
    - a) Develop a simple real-time chat app using Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication. Briefly outline how messages are stored and synced.
    - b) Deploy the app using Firebase Hosting; list the process steps and mention security rule considerations.

### Sample Theory-Based Question Paper (40 Marks)

#### Instructions

- Section A: Attempt all MCQs.
- Section B: Attempt any six out of eight questions.


#### Question Paper

**Section A: MCQ (10 × 1 = 10 marks)**

1. Which statement best describes denormalization in NoSQL?
2. What is the default storage format for documents in MongoDB?
3. Which MongoDB command is used to insert documents?
4. Eventual consistency in NoSQL means:
    - a) Data is always consistent across all nodes.
    - b) Data will become consistent eventually.
    - c) Data is never consistent.
    - d) Only primary node updates.
5. Which Firebase component handles file storage?
    - a) Firestore
    - b) Cloud Messaging
    - c) Storage
    - d) Hosting
6. Sharding in MongoDB is used for:
7. The CAP theorem addresses trade-offs among:
8. In Firebase, authentication is used to:
9. Which index type improves query performance in MongoDB?
10. Which database type is best suited for social networks?

**Section B: Subjective (6 × 5 = 30 marks, attempt any 6)**

1. Explain the key differences between NoSQL databases and RDBMS with examples.
2. Compare and contrast four types of NoSQL databases (with structure, uses and pros/cons).
3. What is eventual consistency? How does it differ from strong consistency? Give use cases.
4. Describe data sharding with an example. What advantages does it offer in MongoDB?
5. Illustrate how a denormalized schema can be designed for a food delivery app in MongoDB.
6. How does MongoDB use replica sets for high availability? Describe their mechanism.
7. Explain CRUD operations in MongoDB with example commands.
8. Describe how Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database work together in a chat app.
